    "What is **Computational Intelligence (CI)** ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Intelligence is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and computational models to solve complex problems that are difficult to solve using traditional mathematical or rule-based methods.</br> It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, and swarm intelligence.\n",

    "### Course content\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the full course syllabus on the course Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is mainly an introduction to the following subjects:\n",
    "- Genetic Algorithms (Ex 2-3)\n",
    "- Fuzzy Logic (Ex 4-5)\n",
    "- Machine Learning & Neural Networks (Ex 6-12)\n",

    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "- Python knowledge\n",
    "- Linear algebra and Statistics&Probability understanding\n",
    "- Control theory basics\n",

    "### Requisites during the course\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completion of 3 HW assignments (act as a sheild for )\n",
    "- Self learning and exercising! </br> Without learning by yourself and make some trials and errors you won't complete the course successfully. </br>Use any source that helps you make a progress - google, youtube, github, chatgpt...   \n",

    "\n",
    "In this course we recommand on using Anaconda as the python development environment.</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is **Anaconda** ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a distribution of the Python programming language that comes with pre-installed data science and scientific computing packages.</br> Its advantages include easy installation, pre-installed packages for data science and scientific computing, and its own package and environment management system.</br> Anaconda simplifies the process of setting up and managing a Python environment for data science, making it an efficient choice for data scientists and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover here how to Install Anaconda and the dependencies packages.</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation - Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have Anaconda installed on your computer - skip to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda download link at [the official web](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the installing process will be very intuitive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: you have an hebrew guide for download Anaconda+pycharm, but it is not include explanations on how to configure the packages.</br>\n",
    "Therfore, I recommend to read the Anaconda installation from the hebrew guide, and then skip to the next parts of this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation - course python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, environment is all the python packages (/libraries) which your projects depend on. </br>\n",
    "It means that for running the course exercises and assignments we will need our specific environment. </br>\n",

    "There are a lot of ways to configure your environment.</br>If you already know what works best for you - feel free to add the requierd packages with your method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover 2 ways of configuring the course env:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Full env in one-shot:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Download ```CI_course.yaml``` from the moodle.\n",
    "   2. Enter \"Environment\" option in the Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "   3. Choose \"import\" option and pick the ```CI_course.yaml``` file in the browser.\n",
    "           <img src=\"assets/import_env.png\" alt= “” width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\">\n",
    "       \n",
    "    If the method above didn't work for you - move next to the second method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Install every package separately using conda/pip command:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Enter the \"Environment\" option in the Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "        2. Choose the \"create\" option and insert the environment name and Python version (we use 3.9).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <img src=\"assets/create_env.png\" alt= “” width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Press the 'play' button next to the new environment you just created, and then choose the \"open terminal\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "        <img src=\"assets/open_terminal.png\" alt= “” width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Install the required packages by typing the command as follows:\n",
    "       \n",
    "           `conda install <package_name>` or `pip install <package_name>` \n",
    "\n",
    "Install the packages below:\n",

    "- numpy\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- scikit-fuzzy (using pip only)\n",
    "- torch (=pytorch)\n",
